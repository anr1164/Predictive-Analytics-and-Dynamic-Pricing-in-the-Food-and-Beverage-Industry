Developed a web-based machine learning application using Python and Flask to optimize restaurant operations. Used Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, including cleaning, merging, encoding, and feature engineering. Built a Decision Tree Regression model with Scikit-learn to accurately forecast weekly food item demand. Designed and implemented a dynamic pricing system that adjusts menu prices based on demand patterns to increase revenue. Performed customer segmentation using demographic data (gender, occupation, etc.) to identify purchase behavior for targeted marketing. Created an interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and Jinja2, enabling restaurant managers to view forecasts and trends through a browser. Included visualizations for demand, sales ratio (veg vs non-veg), and revenue trends, helping managers make data-driven decisions. Applied time-series forecasting to project future revenue, enhancing planning and resource allocation. The system improves inventory management, reduces food waste, and supports better profitability and operational efficiency.
